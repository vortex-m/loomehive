        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">EXCHANGE DUE TO SIZE ISSUES</h2>
        <p>
          Please refer to the size chart mentioned on each product page before confirming your order. If you are unsure about your size, we would love to assist you in finding the perfect size for you. If you still face issues with the size once you receive the product, please raise an email at <a href="mailto:help.bandhanijaipur@gmail.com" className="text-blue-600">help.bandhanijaipur@gmail.com</a> with your order number and the details of the issue you are facing within 2 days of receiving your order. Our team will assist you on a case-to-case basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that we cannot assure you of offering the exchange as it depends on the availability of your size in your design at that time. Additionally, a charge of INR 249 per item will be applied to cover logistics expenses incurred with reverse pick-up and re-dispatch of your order.
        </p>
        <p>
          No size exchange will be facilitated for articles on sale.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">EXCHANGE DUE TO DAMAGED PRODUCTS</h2>
        <p>
          Itâ€™s extremely unlikely for you to receive a damaged, defective, or incorrect product, as our QC team carefully checks all outfits before dispatching them. However, in rare scenarios, if you face such issues, we would be happy to assist you with the exchange of the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please send us an email at <a href="mailto:help.bandhanijaipur@gmail.com" className="text-blue-600">help.bandhanijaipur@gmail.com</a> with details of the issues you are facing, along with an order-opening video for verification purposes and product images within 2 days of receiving your order. All returns will be subject to our verification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your return request is received and verified, we will notify you of the approval or rejection (along with valid justification). Once approved, we will arrange for the reverse pick-up and dispatch a replacement of the same product to you, if available. Your exchange product will be dispatched in 3-5 days after receiving your returned product. If the product is unavailable, we will provide you with store credit of the same amount. The validity of the store credit voucher will be 30 days.
