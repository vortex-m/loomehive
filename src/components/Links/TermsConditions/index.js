        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Colors</h3>
        <p>
          We have done our best to display the colours of the products shown on
          this website as accurately as possible – although they might vary from
          the actual product due to lighting in the picture. Additionally, the
          colors you see also depend on your monitor, and we cannot guarantee
          that your monitor’s display of any color will be accurate.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Washing/ Care Instructions</h3>
        <p>
          All our garments are DRY CLEAN only. We would not be responsible for
          any damage to the garment if the washing instruction is not followed.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Sizing</h3>
        <p>
          The fit of our clothing depends on the cut, fabric, and style of each
          garment. Some garments are designed to have a looser, relaxed fit
          while some garments are styled to be more fitted. Please review our
          sizing guide on the product page before ordering the garment, to
          select the size best suited to you.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">Pricing</h3>
        <p>
          Pricing of garments is subject to our policy and we have the sole
          discretion to determine our prices. Prices for our products are
          subject to change without notice. Additionally, the prices mentioned
          on the Site are not subject to comparison with the same or similar
          product(s) and/or service(s) available through any online or offline
          sale.
